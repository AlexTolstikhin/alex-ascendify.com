  // Below is a fake database stateful entity called StatefulEntity that has two methods
  // on it, save and cancel that just print up what they do, (e.g. print a string Save or
  // Cancel) and always return true. It's not hard to stretch your imagination to where these
  // really use a database session to commit or abort, etc.
  // There is also a companion object which holds on to a map of IDs to stateful entities that
  // simulates the actual database. The save operation updates the entry for that ID in the
  // "database" and you can retrieve an object by its UUID.

  // You could even think of this as a simple database mock object

  // whether it is set or not. The save method should still call the save() on StatefulEntity when it
